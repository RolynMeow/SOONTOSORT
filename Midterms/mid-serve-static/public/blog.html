    <h2>KUROMI</h2>
    <p>
      Kuromi (クロミ, Kuromi) is My Melody's rival, who is a white rabbit or imp-like creature wearing a black jester's hat with a pink skull on the front and a black devil's tail. The skull's facial expression changes to match Kuromi's mood. Fittingly, her birthday is Halloween (October 31st). Her name translates from Japanese to English as "black beauty".<br/>
      Kuromi's appearance is also similar to those of cartoon characters from the 1990s such as Pichu from Pokémon. Kuromi has become a popular character for the punk, scene, and goth crowds due to her appearance.<br />
      lthough she may look tough and punk, she is actually very girly and is attracted to good-looking guys! Kuromi enjoys writing in her diary and is hooked on romantic short stories. Her favorite colors are black and hot pink. Her favorite food is shallots, all kinds of meat, and in recent Kuromi merchandise cherries have been shown. Despite being a villain, Kuromi is mostly into food and even cooks. You might call her a rowdy free spirit.
